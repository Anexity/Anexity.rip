    <p><h4>Learning Markup and File Systems</h4></p>
    <p>
        This website, as is very obvious, has been built by me and will probably continue to be developed and hopefully improved over time,
        but I have already made some experiences that entirely reshaped the way I look at data systems, since I've always struggled to
        understand how the system of pages interacting with each other works. Now that I realise how it works, or rather that the internet
        in some way is also just entirely a datasystem with a frontend, I feel a lot different about it. It's rather wild to me, 
        so even though its probably obvious to you, to me it was not, so interesting stuff, nowhere to go with this, just that.
