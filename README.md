# Anexity.rip

This is a Website built as a fully local implementation
of a HTML/CSS only space used mostly for achieving what
my school has set out for my class to do and learn in
HTML/CSS

Also hopefully it will become enough of a Website to 
replace the current site123 made one linked to my
domain, since this is a way more engaging way of doing
and managing websites.
